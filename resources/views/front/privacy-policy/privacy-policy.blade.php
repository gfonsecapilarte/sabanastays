                    <p>
                        Sabanastays.com does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse the Sabanastays.com web sites unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide such information to us. In other words we won’t know your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information simply because you browsed the Sabanastays.com web sites unless you:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Access the web site from a link in an email that we sent;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have created a profile and log-in when you access the web site.
                            When we do need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will ask you, your employer, your relocation company or travel agency to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our properties, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and room preference to process your reservation. We may collect this information directly from you by telephone, fax, email, at the counter, upon completion of an application or enrolment form, or through your use of our web sites.
                            Information may also be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) registering for mySabanastays.com program membership, (iii) submitting a job application, (iv) submitting a credit application, or (v) responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or reservation confirmations), (vi) registering for, or responding to a subscription request for our newsletter. We endeavour to collect information only with your knowledge and with your permission if necessary.

                    <h2 class="mg-sec-left-title">Types of Information</h2>

                        You may be offered the choice not to submit your personal information or to decide what communications you want to receive from us. Doing so however, may cause certain transactions to become affected. For instance, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.
